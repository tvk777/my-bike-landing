# MyBike Landing Page

MyBike Store is a responsive landing page for a modern bicycle and e-bike brand, designed to showcase a clean UI, clear visual hierarchy, and well-structured layouts. The project emphasizes modern front-end standards and responsive design principles.

## Project Overview

This is a static front-end project built to demonstrate best practices in layout composition, CSS architecture, and maintainable styling. The page mirrors a real-world e-commerce landing page, featuring intuitive navigation, clearly separated content sections, and adaptive behavior across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

The focus of the project is on semantic HTML structure, reusable SCSS patterns, and consistent styling using the BEM methodology.

- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **SASS (SCSS)**

- **Parcel** (as the project bundler)
